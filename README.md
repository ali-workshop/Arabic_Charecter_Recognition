# Arabic Character Recognition

Arabic Character Recognition is a machine learning-based project that aims to identify and classify handwritten or printed Arabic characters from images using deep learning techniques.

## 📌 Features

- Optical Character Recognition (OCR) for Arabic script
- Supports isolated characters
- Deep learning model (CNN-based)
- Dataset preprocessing and augmentation
- Evaluation metrics (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix)

## 🧠 Model Architecture

The model is built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the following layers:

- Convolutional + ReLU
- MaxPooling
- Dropout
- Fully Connected Layer
- Softmax Output

> Framework: TensorFlow / PyTorch  
> Dataset: [Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset (AHCD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mloey1/ahcd1)

## 🗃️ Dataset

The AHCD dataset includes 16,800 images for training and 4,200 images for testing, covering all 28 Arabic letters in isolated form.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/arabic-character-recognition.git
cd arabic-character-recognition
  
```
